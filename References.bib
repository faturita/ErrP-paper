abstract = {Restorative brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are increasingly used to provide feedback of neuronal states in a bid to normalize pathological brain activity and achieve behavioral gains. However, patients and healthy subjects alike often show a large variability, or even inability, of brain self-regulation for BCI control, known as BCI illiteracy. Although current co-adaptive algorithms are powerful for assistive BCIs, their inherent class switching clashes with the operant conditioning goal of restorative BCIs. Moreover, due to the treatment rationale, the classifier of restorative BCIs usually has a constrained feature space, thus limiting the possibility of classifier adaptation. In this context, we applied a Bayesian model of neurofeedback and reinforcement learning for different threshold selection strategies to study the impact of threshold adaptation of a linear classifier on optimizing restorative BCIs. For each feedback iteration, we first determined the thresholds that result in minimal action entropy and maximal instructional efficiency. We then used the resulting vector for the simulation of continuous threshold adaptation. We could thus show that threshold adaptation can improve reinforcement learning, particularly in cases of BCI illiteracy. Finally, on the basis of information-theory, we provided an explanation for the achieved benefits of adaptive threshold setting.},

abstract = {Interactions between an organism and its environment are commonly treated in the framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDP). While standard MDP is aimed solely at maximizing expected future rewards (value), the circular flow of information between the agent and its environment is generally ignored. In particular, the information gained from the environment by means of perception and the information involved in the process of action selection (i.e., control) are not treated in the standard MDP setting. In this paper, we focus on the control information and show how it can be combined with the reward measure in a unified way. Both of these measures satisfy the familiar Bellman recursive equations, and their linear combination (the free-energy) provides an interesting new optimization criterion. The tradeoff between value and information, explored using our INFO-RL algorithm, provides a principled justification for stochastic (soft) policies. We use computational learning theory to show that these optimal policies are also robust to uncertainties in settings with only partial knowledge of the MDP parameters. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract = {Q-learning (Watkins, 1989) is a simple way for agents to learn how to act optimally in controlled Markovian domains. It amounts to an incremental method for dynamic programming which imposes limited computational demands. It works by successively improving its evaluations of the quality of particular actions at particular states. This paper presents and proves in detail a convergence theorem forQ-learning based on that outlined in Watkins (1989). We show thatQ-learning converges to the optimum action-values with probability 1 so long as all actions are repeatedly sampled in all states and the action-values are represented discretely. We also sketch extensions to the cases of non-discounted, but absorbing, Markov environments, and where manyQ values can be changed each iteration, rather than just one.},

@article{Lotte2018,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. APPROACH We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. MAIN RESULTS We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. SIGNIFICANCE This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.},

The large body of research in BCIs based on event-related potentials (ERP) use temporal features, which have demonstrated to be stable for each user along time, but do not generalize well among tasks different from the calibration task. This paper explores the use of low frequency features to improve the generalization capabilities of the BCIs using error-potentials. The results show that there exists a stable pattern in the frequency domain that allows a classifier to generalize among the tasks. Furthermore, the study also shows that it is possible to combine temporal and frequency features to obtain the best of both domains. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

But why would a healthy person use a still-unproven technology such as BCI for game interaction? BCI provides a combination of information and features that no other input modality can offer. But for general acceptance of this technology, usability and user experience will need to be taken into account when designing such systems. Therefore, this chapter gives an overview of the state of the art of BCI in games and discusses the consequences of applying knowledge from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to the design of BCI for games. The integration of HCI with BCI is illustrated by research examples and showcases, intended to take this promising technology out of the lab. Future research needs to move beyond feasibility tests, to prove that BCI is also applicable in realistic, real-world settings.},

In this context, electrophysiological measures of error detection, directly measured from a person's brain activity as Error-related Potentials (ErrPs), can be exploited to provide passive adaptation of an external semi-autonomous system to the human. This concept was implemented in an online robot learning task, where user's evaluation of the robot's actions, in terms of detected ErrP, was exploited to update a reward function in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. Results from both simulated and experimental studies show that the introduction of human evaluation in the robot learning loop allows for: (1) the acceleration of optimal policy learning in a target reaching task, (2) the introduction of a further degree of control in robot learning, namely identification of one among multiple targets, according to the user's will. Overall, presented results support the potential of human-robot co-adaptive and co-operative strategies to develop human-centered assistive technologies.},

@article{Holroyd2009,
abstract = {A recent theory holds that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) uses reinforcement learning signals conveyed by the midbrain dopamine system to facilitate flexible action selection. According to this position, the impact of reward prediction error signals on ACC modulates the amplitude of a component of the event-related brain potential called the error-related negativity (ERN). The theory predicts that ERN amplitude is monotonically related to the expectedness of the event: It is larger for unexpected outcomes than for expected outcomes. However, a recent failure to confirm this prediction has called the theory into question. In the present article, we investigated this discrepancy in three trial-and-error learning experiments. All three experiments provided support for the theory, but the effect sizes were largest when an optimal response strategy could actually be learned. This observation suggests that ACC utilizes dopamine reward prediction error signals for adaptive decision making when the optimal behavior is, in fact, learnable. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

@article{Chavarriaga2014,
abstract = {The ability to recognize errors is crucial for efficient behavior. Numerous studies have identified electrophysiological correlates of error recognition in the human brain (error-related potentials, ErrPs). Consequently, it has been proposed to use these signals to improve human-computer interaction (HCI) or brain-machine interfacing (BMI). Here, we present a review of over a decade of developments toward this goal. This body of work provides consistent evidence that ErrPs can be successfully detected on a single-trial basis, and that they can be effectively used in both HCI and BMI applications. We first describe the ErrP phenomenon and follow up with an analysis of different strategies to increase the robustness of a system by incorporating single-trial ErrP recognition, either by correcting the machine's actions or by providing means for its error-based adaptation. These approaches can be applied both when the user employs traditional HCI input devices or in combination with another BMI channel. Finally, we discuss the current challenges that have to be overcome in order to fully integrate ErrPs into practical applications. This includes, in particular, the characterization of such signals during real(istic) applications, as well as the possibility of extracting richer information from them, going beyond the time-locked decoding that dominates current approaches. {\textcopyright} 2014 Chavarriaga, Sobolewski and Mill{\'{a}}n.},
